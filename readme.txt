An ultra lightweight solution for sharp retina images on any devices from desktop to mobile! No need to configure any options.

=== Frequently Asked Questions ===

How this plugin actually works? It's pretty simple. It specifies 2x less maximum width for any image size, available for later use in srcset attribute. So, 2x size image will be used instead. If screen width is 1024px, so 2048px width image will be displayed, if such image size is available and exists in the srcset attribute, for example. You no longer need to disable "Responsive Images" feature, introduced in WordPress 4.4! Wins :)
